# HayekCop

HAYEKCOP is an ERC20 token, but its supply can be adjusted by contracting 
and expanding it proportionally among holders according to market conditions, 
 so that the token price is worth 100 COP adjusted by the Colombian IPC.

 The token name is a combination of the last name of Austrian School economist
Friedrich Hayek and the Colombian peso ticker COP, in honor of the deceased economist
for his significant contributions to decentralization in money markets.
